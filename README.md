# TimeFrame

The News today is hectic, but so is the way we access our News. To stay up to date with interests, friends, and global events, people keep up with many many different disparate sites. The much-needed solution is a clean and elegant interface; TimeFrame, the ideal tool to access all of your favorite content sources in one place. 

While most sites (any with a built-in RSS feed) are supported by default, TimeFrame has special integrations with YouTube, Spotify, Twitter, and Reddit, to make loading sources even simpler.

TimeFrame is composed of three seperate modular apps that all work in conjunction:
- webserver: the frontend and db, allows users to see new events and access further details
- scraper: loosely used as the backend, has APIs to read and write feed data, and access content of sites within update feeds
- ai: generated content grouping and event summaries, allows for highlighting of events that are relevant or interesting to the user
